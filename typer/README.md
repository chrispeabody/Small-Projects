Typer.py was a very simple module I created to make certain text-based console programs more "fancy." When including it in a project, you get access to the type(message, pause, end). Essentially this function prints the message to the console, one letter at a time, with "pause" amounut of milliseconds between letters, and an "end" character at the conclusion of the message.

Running typer.py as a main program will show some examples of how it looks.
